# Employee Attrition Prediction using IBM HR Analytics Dataset

This project builds a predictive model for employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics Dataset. The goal is to identify factors contributing to employee turnover and derive actionable insights for HR strategies.

## Project Overview

The project follows a typical data science pipeline:
1.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The raw data is loaded, irrelevant columns are removed, and categorical variables are encoded.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the dataset to understand key trends, class distribution, and feature correlations with attrition.
3.  **Model Training:** Training Random Forest and Logistic Regression models to predict employee attrition.
4.  **Model Explainability:** Using SHAP values to interpret the model's predictions and identify the most influential features.
5.  **Actionable Insights:** Summarizing key findings and providing recommendations for HR based on the analysis and model results.
